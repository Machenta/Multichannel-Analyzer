# Multichannel-Analyzer
 
 This is a basic multichannel analyzer primarily designed to Radon detection and measurement from sample exhalation.
 It contains simple acquisition tools based on serial communication with an Arduino through its serial port, and basic data analysis such as chamber leakage evaluation. 
 The goal is to constantly update this program with an increasing number of functions and better user interface.
